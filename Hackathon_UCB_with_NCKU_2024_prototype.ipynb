    "1. **Identify Key Information**: Identify the key medication(s) or condition(s) the patient is asking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify Types of Information Needed**: Determine the type of information requested: side effects, dosage, drug interactions, indication, mechanism of action, route of elimination, toxicity, food interactions, or adverse drug reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assess Data Sources**: Consider which data sources (vectorstore (vc), knowledge graph (kg), SQL database (sql)) would be most relevant for the query at hand, even if you won't actually retrieve the data.\n",
    "   (a) Consult vectorstore data for general medication background.\n",
    "   (b) If the question involves how one drug relates to another drug (e.g., drug interactions, not food interactions), check the knowledge graph data.\n",
    "   (c) If the question involves standardized data (e.g., drug to gene relationship information), check the SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Formulate Steps for Information Gathering**:\n",
    "   - **Drug Interactions**: Outline steps to check for known drug interactions, contraindications, or safety precautions.\n",
    "   - **Dosage Information**: Detail the process to verify the recommended dosages, considering patient factors like age, weight, or existing conditions.\n",
    "   - **Side Effects**: List steps to gather known side effects, their prevalence, and severity.\n",
    "   - **Indication**: Identify the approved uses of the medication.\n",
    "   - **Mechanism of Action**: Describe how the drug works at a molecular or biochemical level.\n",
    "   - **Route of Elimination**: Determine the primary routes by which the drug is removed from the body.\n",
    "   - **Toxicity**: Assess any known toxic effects or overdose symptoms.\n",
    "   - **Food Interactions**: Check for any interactions between the medication and food or dietary components.\n",
    "   - **Adverse Drug Reactions**: Gather information on adverse reactions reported with the drug.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Synthesize Information**: Integrate information from all sources, ensuring consistency and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Provide Answer or Disclaimer**:\n",
    "   - If sufficient data can be synthesized and confident with the information, provide a direct, evidence-based answer.\n",
    "   - If there's not enough information available or not confident, state so explicitly.\n",

For example, you might add Network Video Recorders for scalable security camera management (Protect), or a Cloud Key for VoIP phone (Talk) and door access control (Access).\\n\\nWhat happens when my credit card cannot be charged?\\n\\nIf your payment method fails on the billing date for any reason, it will be retried three more times (after one, two and seven days). You will get email notifications prompting for an updated payment method. If all three retries fail, your subscription will be canceled.\\n\\nWhat happens when I cancel my subscription?\\n\\nWhen you cancel your subscription, your Official UniFi Hosting instance remains active until the end of the prepaid period. At the end of the billing period, your Official UniFi Hosting instance will be terminated.'\n",

[Adopt your UniFi devices](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/204909754-UniFi-Device-Adoption-Methods-for-Remote-UniFi-Controllers) that will be managed, or [migrate them from an existing deployment](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008976393-UniFi-Backups-and-Migration).\\n3. Use the [Site Manager](https://unifi.ui.com/site-manager) or UniFi Mobile App ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unifi/id1057750338) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubnt.easyunifi)) for continued management.\\n\\nHow many devices can I manage?\\n\\nUp to 1,000 UniFi devices can be adopted depending on your subscription tier.\\n\\nHow is this different than a normal UniFi Console or Cloud Gateway?\\n\\nUniFi Consoles are hardware devices responsible for running UniFi application software and providing remote management through unifi.ui.com. Cloud Gateways are UniFi Consoles that have an integrated gateway to support powerful routing, VPN, and network security.\\n\\nOfficial UniFi Hosting is a cloud-only solution for UniFi Network, however an independent gateway such as the Gateway Professional is still required to enable routing, VPN and network security features.\\n\\nWhich applications are supported with Official UniFi Hosting?\\n\\nOfficial UniFi Hosting is a dedicated solution for Network device management, however it can be used alongside other UniFi Consoles for expanded application support. For example, you might add Network Video Recorders for scalable security camera management (Protect), or a Cloud Key for VoIP phone (Talk) and door access control (Access).\\n\\nWhat happens when my credit card cannot be charged?\\n\\nIf your payment method fails on the billing date for any reason, it will be retried three more times (after one, two and seven days). You will get email notifications prompting for an updated payment method. If all three retries fail, your subscription will be canceled.\\n\\nWhat happens when I cancel my subscription?\\n\\nWhen you cancel your subscription, your Official UniFi Hosting instance remains active until the end of the prepaid period. At the end of the billing period, your Official UniFi Hosting instance will be terminated.'\n",

Additionally, UniFi has easy solutions if you happen to exceed your Console's limits.\\n\\nCamera Capacity Overview\\n\\nUniFi Protect\\x92s dashboard shows you an estimate of how many cameras your UniFi Console can effectively manage.\\n\\nUniFi Protect will notify you when you are exceeding the recommended limit. While these are not hard limits, they were designed to ensure your system is capable of providing quality video playback, fast loading times, and most importantly, not missing out on any recordings.\\n\\nExceeding Camera Capacity\\n\\nYou might be approaching or exceeding camera capacity due to a number of factors:\\n- Active user volume within UniFi Protect\\n- A high number of Viewports in use\\n- Storage Disk Health\\n\\nIf you exceed camera capacity, consider upgrading your hardware by adding the UniFi Network Video Recorder (UNVR) or UNVR Pro. The UNVR Pro has the highest camera capacity of our UniFi Consoles and offers scalability for any enterprise environment thanks to its stacking feature which allows you to chain together multiple UNVR Pros. See Backups and Migration to learn more.\\n\\nUniFi\\x92s [Resource Calculator](https://www.ui.com/cloud-gateways/resource-calculator) can give you a better understanding of which UniFi Console will suit your needs, or use the table below as a general guide: \\n\\nCamera capacity has been increased for all consoles as of UniFi Protect v4.0:\\n\\nUniFi Console Model: UDR | HD: 5 | 2K: 2 | 4K: 1\\nUniFi Console Model: UDM-PRO | HD: 24 | 2K: 14 | 4K: 8\\nUniFi Console Model: UDM-PRO-MAX | HD: 50 | 2K: 25 | 4K: 15\\nUniFi Console Model: UDM-SE | HD: 24 | 2K: 14 | 4K: 8\\nUniFi Console Model: UDW | HD: 12 | 2K: 7 | 4K: 4\\nUniFi Console Model: UCK-G2-PLUS* | HD: 24 | 2K: 14 | 4K: 8\\nUniFi Console Model: UNVR | HD: 60 | 2K: 30 | 4K: 18\\nUniFi Console Model: 2 x UNVR (Stacked) | HD: 120 | 2K: 60 | 4K: 36\\nUniFi Console Model: UNVR-PRO | HD: 70 | 2K: 35 | 4K: 24\\nUniFi Console Model: 2 x UNVR-PRO (Stacked) | HD: 140 | 2K: 70 | 4K: 48\\n\\n*Assumes the UCK-G2-PLUS is dedicated to UniFi Protect only.

Additionally, UniFi has easy solutions if you happen to exceed your Console's limits.\\n\\nCamera Capacity Overview\\n\\nUniFi Protect\\x92s dashboard shows you an estimate of how many cameras your UniFi Console can effectively manage.\\n\\nUniFi Protect will notify you when you are exceeding the recommended limit. While these are not hard limits, they were designed to ensure your system is capable of providing quality video playback, fast loading times, and most importantly, not missing out on any recordings.\\n\\nExceeding Camera Capacity\\n\\nYou might be approaching or exceeding camera capacity due to a number of factors:\\n- Active user volume within UniFi Protect\\n- A high number of Viewports in use\\n- Storage Disk Health\\n\\nIf you exceed camera capacity, consider upgrading your hardware by adding the UniFi Network Video Recorder (UNVR) or UNVR Pro. The UNVR Pro has the highest camera capacity of our UniFi Consoles and offers scalability for any enterprise environment thanks to its stacking feature which allows you to chain together multiple UNVR Pros. See Backups and Migration to learn more.\\n\\nUniFi\\x92s [Resource Calculator](https://www.ui.com/cloud-gateways/resource-calculator) can give you a better understanding of which UniFi Console will suit your needs, or use the table below as a general guide: \\n\\nCamera capacity has been increased for all consoles as of UniFi Protect v4.0:\\n\\nUniFi Console Model: UDR | HD: 5 | 2K: 2 | 4K: 1\\nUniFi Console Model: UDM-PRO | HD: 24 | 2K: 14 | 4K: 8\\nUniFi Console Model: UDM-PRO-MAX | HD: 50 | 2K: 25 | 4K: 15\\nUniFi Console Model: UDM-SE | HD: 24 | 2K: 14 | 4K: 8\\nUniFi Console Model: UDW | HD: 12 | 2K: 7 | 4K: 4\\nUniFi Console Model: UCK-G2-PLUS* | HD: 24 | 2K: 14 | 4K: 8\\nUniFi Console Model: UNVR | HD: 60 | 2K: 30 | 4K: 18\\nUniFi Console Model: 2 x UNVR (Stacked) | HD: 120 | 2K: 60 | 4K: 36\\nUniFi Console Model: UNVR-PRO | HD: 70 | 2K: 35 | 4K: 24\\nUniFi Console Model: 2 x UNVR-PRO (Stacked) | HD: 140 | 2K: 70 | 4K: 48\\n\\n*Assumes the UCK-G2-PLUS is dedicated to UniFi Protect only.
